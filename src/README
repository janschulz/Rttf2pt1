This directory contains sources for utility programs used by the fonts
package.

## ttf2pt1

The sources for ttf2pt1 have the following changes from the original version 3.4.4:

* The file `ft.c` was modified so that, when compiled with the `-pedantic` flag, the compiler doesn't complain about an empty file.


## freetype2

The sources for Freetype 2 are unchanged from version 2.0.8. This version
is used because the ttf2pt1 Makefile references it directly. With later
versions of Freetype 2 (>2.1.1), ttf2pt1 won't build properly.
